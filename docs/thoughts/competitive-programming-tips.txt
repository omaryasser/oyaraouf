10:T4d7,To be able to solve more difficult and deep problems, you need different tools in your pocket. Basically, different Algorithms and Data Structures in this case. So your plan has to always include new algorithms and data structures that you are learning and practicing. By practicing, I mean that once you learn a new algorithm or a new data structure, you need to solve easy, medium, and hard problems using it. You need to make sure that it's not just a new tool in your pocket, but a new tool that you can really use. Just knowing the algorithm is not enough at all. By just knowing and memorizing the algorithm, you will just be able to solve straightforward problems using it. That's not helpful. You need to understand the algorithm and its variants deep enough to be able to tweak it and use for different use cases. Not just that, sometimes you will need it to solve a subproblem of the bigger problem so using it needs to come naturally to your mind by recognizing the patterns and the use cases that it comes in handy with. It's like practicing different chess plans. Will you iterate over all the chess plans you memorized in the middle of a game? It won't work, they will only come naturally to your mind after using them a lot.6:["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-3xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 bg-white flex flex-col items-center","children":["$","article",null,{"className":"flex flex-col items-center w-full","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"flex flex-col w-full items-center bg-white mb-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"relative w-20 h-20 flex-shrink-0","children":["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","passHref":true,"children":["$","$Lf",null,{"src":"/favicon.png","alt":"Omar's avatar","fill":true,"className":"rounded-full object-cover"}]}]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"flex-1 font-bold text-3xl px-4 text-center py-4","children":"Competitive Programming | Resources, Technique & Tips"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xs text-gray-600 mb-4 text-center","children":"2022-07-26"}],["$","div",null,{"id":"react-markdown","className":"prose max-w-none text-black","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":["$","em","em-0",{"children":"Note that it has been a while since I was heavily involved in practicing, so the resources I'll mention might have been superseded already.
