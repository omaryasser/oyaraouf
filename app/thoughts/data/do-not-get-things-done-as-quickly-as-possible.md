This article looks at balancing getting things done quickly with investing in learning opportunities, even if it slows you down.

Below are two extreme attitudes to avoid and the healthy balance you should aim for:

## Extreme Getting Things Done Attitude
- When I’m assigned a project, I try to finish it as quickly as possible.  
- I never question and I immediately apply every piece of guidance I get from more senior colleagues.  
- I don’t spend time questioning the usefulness or purpose of my assigned projects.  
- I don’t learn anything unrelated to the project before delivering it, even if it’s in my domain and could help in the future.

## Extreme Long-Term Investor Attitude
- When I’m assigned a project, I research its background, history, and similar completed projects.  
- I consider different approaches and ask senior colleagues why they recommended a particular method before starting.  
- Whenever I’m stuck, I spend as long as necessary to unblock myself by myself.  
- Before using any dependency (e.g., a third-party library or another team’s API), I make sure I dig deep into it to fully understand its design and implementation.

### Some General Advice
- The “Extreme Getting Things Done” attitude yields more short-term wins, while the “Extreme Long-Term Investor” attitude yields more long-term gains. You need both.
- If you lean too much towards "Extreme Getting Things Done" attitude, you risk investing in long-term growth opportunities and you will be mostly steered by your assigned projects.
- If you lean too much toward “Extreme Long-Term Investor” attitude you risk missing deadlines and damaging your performance reputation.
- The more junior you are, the closer you should stay to the “Extreme Getting Things Done” end of the spectrum but you still shouldn't be at the end of it.
- The more senior you are, the more you'd have to lean toward the ““Extreme Long-Term Investor” end.
- At any level, strive for the right balance between short-term delivery and long-term learning.

Below are examples of how a junior engineer might balance these attitudes:


### Example 2: Using a Team’s API
- **Extreme “Getting Things Done”:** I scan the API, find that E3 works, and stop there.  
- **Extreme “Long-Term Investor”:** I compare similar APIs, study all team T’s endpoints (including E5), analyze performance trade-offs, and review others’ choices.  
- **Balanced Approach:** I review all relevant endpoints—E4 and E6 look best. Their docs are complex, so I ask a senior colleague. My tech lead confirms E6 is ideal for reason R. I learned something new and will use E6.

### Example 3: Fixing a Bug in Function F
- **Extreme “Getting Things Done”:** I fix the bug, update the tests, and mark it done.  
- **Extreme “Long-Term Investor”:** I investigate why the bug matters to users, reproduce it, audit related code for best-practice violations, rewrite multiple functions, add tests, and then finish.  
- **Balanced Approach:** I understand where F fits in its class, notice an unfamiliar standard-library function and read its docs, debug and fix the bug, write a test, and mark the task done.

### Example 4: Debugging a Feature
- **Extreme “Getting Things Done”:** I skim the code, make quick edits until the bug vanishes, and then close the task.  
- **Extreme “Long-Term Investor”:** I research the best debugger for this codebase, learn a new IDE, study the class structure in depth, then debug.  
- **Balanced Approach:** I identify available debugging methods—code inspection and logging—skip the time investment in a new debugger for now, and remind myself to explore it later.

It’s not an exact science, and these examples reflect just one perspective. Your “balanced” approach may vary depending on your experience, deadlines, and project context. The key is to remain aware of both attitudes and avoid leaning exclusively on one at the expense of the other.
