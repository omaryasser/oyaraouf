My dear colleagues from all over the world, I think what's currently going on in the world is a prime opportunity for everyone to reevaluate their perspectives on fundamental life questions they once thought settled. Taking this seriously can be a life changer for many.

For a very long time in my life, I have been primarily influenced by the information and the points of view that I hear from my colleagues, my teachers, popular newspapers, popular TV channels, popular influencers, etc. The moment I genuinely engaged with an opposing perspective straight **from the mouth of the one** who held it, was a pivotal point in my life.

It's clear to everyone that money and power can acquire both tangible and intangible resources. It's also clear that it's very often that money and power can, and sometimes legally, buy resources that harm society. Information is one of the most, if not the most, valuable resources in the current era. It's not hard to understand that people with money and power might want to acquire and propagate information that serves their interests. This enforcement can get as large as influencing a whole education system. Our minds may be trapped in one of the prisons built by one of the powerful information prison builders.

The following are some suggestions in the form of simple steps that I believe can help us get out of our mind prisons.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 1: Decide on a controversial topic. Please note that by controversial here, I mean, controversial considering the whole world's point of view on it and not just within your family, city, or country.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 2: Arrive at a clear personal stance. We have been living for a while and every one of us has consumed an amount of information about history, religion, politics, etc.. We studied some in school, we read some in newspapers or books, and we talked about some with our friends and colleagues. Sit alone, organize your thoughts, and arrive at a clear personal stance on the controversial topic. If you find that you can't then that means that you are 100% ready to escape your mind prisons and proceed to the next step. If you arrive at a personal stance, then you are either right or in a mind prison, also proceed to the next step.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 3: Honestly explore the opposing point of view. This one requires significant discipline to avoid confirmation bias. The following are some suggestions about how to do this exploration:

Search on search engines, streaming services, and social media explicitly with the opposing point of view.

Search for hashtags that are promoted by the adopters of the opposing point of view.

If the opposing point of view is spoken in a foreign language that you can't speak, then find written material and translate it. Find articles, posts, and posts in these languages and everything can be translated, even transcribed, with a couple of clicks today.

Read about the matter in newspapers that you have never read before.

If your discipline is high enough, you can also search for a book that most of the adopters of the opposing point of view recommended.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 4: The result. I promise you, if you have never done this before, you will be astonished by the findings. You might end up with the same stance but you will still be astonished by the amount of facts that were intentionally hidden and the ones that were fabricated for you.
