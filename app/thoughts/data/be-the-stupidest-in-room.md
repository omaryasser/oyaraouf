One of the most effective catalysts for growth is to push yourself to rooms in which you are the least smart or experienced person.

These are the rooms in which you will learn a lot from others and realize how far from perfect you are. This realization will push you to work on yourself and seek more knowledge.

I truly feel in the right place when I am the least smart/experienced person in the room.
