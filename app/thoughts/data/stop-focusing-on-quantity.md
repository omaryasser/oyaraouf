Sometimes we tend to measure our accomplishments by the quantity (of books, courses, certificates, etc..) and not quality. That leaves us with way little overall knowledge than what we could have acquired.
Pay attention to the following 5 points.

1. Time is limited so acknowledge that it is not possible to finish every single resource on one topic in any field. So choose your resources wisely.

2. Always question the percentage that you absorbed from a resource after finishing it. Finishing a book/course in 1 week but absorbing 90% of it is much better than finishing a book/course in 1 day but absorbing only 5% of.

3. Summarize and take notes. This will help you easily revisit and revise the most important takeaways that you have learned.

4. Time spent rereading/rewatching what you don't understand is not wasted but actually well invested.

5. Don't learn passively. I may write another full post on how important is this point, but mainly try to use what you learn, invent something new using it or explain it to others.
